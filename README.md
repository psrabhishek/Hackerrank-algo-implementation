Hard and logical problems in Hackerrank-implementation 
(https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms/implementation) 

This contains hard level and few logical questions which have low success rate( less than 75% or so).
Please try before you can go through my logic, and i have added comments every where to help you understand the logic better.

All the programs are in C++, as I am still learning other languages like JAVA or Python.
But soon i ll upload in other languages also.
